<h1>Website Aggregator</h1>
<h2>Task</h2>
 
<h3> Make a website showing an aggregated list of blog posts. You can collect the details of the blogs from RSS feeds and display them in the form of a list or grid on the main page. The list entries must have the title of the blog post, the first couple of lines of the post as well as a link to the post. The website may be extended later so that the user will be able to select from some given categories (entertainment, news, sports, etc.) and get a list of blog posts related to that.</h3.
